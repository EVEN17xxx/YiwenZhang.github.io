**03.2025 | Echo Chambers & Privacy: Xiaohongshu Case Study**

Examined how China’s Xiaohongshu recommendation algorithm may create ideological echo chambers and assessed its data-collection/privacy practices. Reviewed app permissions, profiling methods, and compared to Western platforms—drawing on echo-chamber theory and privacy risk frameworks.

**09.2024 | Wage Inequality & Sexual Orientation**

Analysed ESS waves across Europe to isolate the impact of sexual orientation on wages among women. Ran regression models controlling for age, education, and country fixed-effects; explored intersectionality and quantified the extra wage gap experienced by lesbian versus heterosexual women.

**06.2024 | Economic Freedom and the Role of Government** 

Investigated how government size and legal frameworks influence economic freedom using the 2016 Human Freedom Index dataset ("hfi2008_2016"). Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and identify key drivers of freedom metrics, followed by Hierarchical Clustering to group 162 countries into meaningful economic categories. Used `missMDA` to handle missing values robustly, ensuring reliable imputations and complete multivariate analysis. Findings highlighted the structural role of government regulation and its association with varying levels of economic liberty worldwide.

**03.2024 | Discrete Choice Modelling - Relation between Education and Income** 

Developed and estimated multinomial logistic and linear probability models on 2015 American Community Survey data (IPUMS), examining how education level, age, and sex predict high-income status. Conducted robustness checks, interaction analyses, and interpreted marginal effects to assess the payoff of different educational credentials.

**03.2024 | Social Network Analysis - “Help-Seeking Among Hungarian Teenagers”**

Used four waves of panel data to map “ask for help” and “kindness” networks in secondary schools. Computed centrality and transitivity measures, applied community detection, and tested hypotheses on reciprocity, homophily, and kindness effects in peer support.

**01.2024 | Two-Child Policy & Fertility Intentions**

Investigated why China’s shift to a full two-child policy failed to boost birth rates. Employed survey data on women’s childbearing intentions, used difference-in-differences to test causal effects of policy change, and modelled factors moderating fertility decisions.
